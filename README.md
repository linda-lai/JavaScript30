## Background
Hi, hello and hey!

This repository contains my workings through the [JavaScript30](https://javascript30.com/) course by Wes Bos. I'm currently a student at Coder Academy completing a Diploma of Information Technology in a full-stack web development immersive bootcamp, learning JavaScript for the first time.

The contained projects are designed to build familiarity with the fundamentals of vanilla JavaScript and working in the DOM by building things - 30 things in fact, without frameworks, compilers, libraries or abtraction.

As a newcomer to coding and JavaScript, these tutorials have been a great resource and way to learn by doing.
